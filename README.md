# RemoteRadio

RemoteRadio is an open system for real time remote control of amateur radio equipment via the Internet, including streaming audio, station control and monitoring, and lots more.   It was designed with multiple users, low latency control, stability, and streaming audio in mind. 

This is at least the fourth full redesign that I've done in building remote controlled internet radio systems over the last 20+ years.   I think that should be enough, it's now time to make it public.



## Explore the RemoteRadio Network

To see first hand what Remote Radio is all about, visit <http://remoteradio.com>

There you will find a list of remote stations which are available for remote use.  All of these stations run this RemoteRadio software.

## Make your remote station available

The full vision of RemoteRadio is that anyone can customize RemoteRadio on their station and allow it to be part of the [RemoteRadio Network]().   

If you have some hardware and software skills, or know someone who does, we encourage you to put your station on the air.  See the [Station Implementers Guide]() for more information. 

## Technology

RemoteRadio borrows concepts and algorithms of previous remote control work that I've done, but reimplemented around the exceptional fault tolerant Elixir/Erlang ecosystem, and now sports a Javascript UI.  

The choice of architecture, language (Elixir), and technology that I've chosen are sure to be controversial for some.  Read [Architectural Overview]() if you feel the need for an understanding of the design choices I've made.
