# RemoteRadio (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

RemoteRadio is an open system for real time remote control of amateur radio equipment via the Internet, including streaming audio, station control and monitoring, and lots more.   It was designed with multiple users, low latency control, stability, and streaming audio in mind. 

This is at least the fourth full redesign that I've done in building remote controlled internet radio systems over the last 20+ years.   I think that 
should be enough, it's now time to make it public.

__As of October, 2013, this project is still being set up.  Please check back again later.__
