## Explore the RemoteRadio Network

To see first hand what Remote Radio is all about, visit <http://remoteradio.com>

There you will find a list of remote stations which are available for remote use.  All of these stations run this RemoteRadio software.

## Make your remote station available

The full vision of RemoteRadio is that anyone can customize RemoteRadio on their station and allow it to be part of the [RemoteRadio Network]().   

If you have some hardware and software skills, or know someone who does, we encourage you to put your station on the air.  See the [Station Implementers Guide]() for more information. 


## Technology

RemoteRadio borrows concepts and algorithms of previous remote control work that I've done, but reimplemented around the exceptional fault tolerant Elixir/Erlang ecosystem, and now sports a Javascript UI.  

The choice of architecture, language (Elixir), and technology that I've chosen are sure to be controversial for some.  Read [Architectural Overview]() if you feel the need for an understanding of the design choices I've made.
